## Features

* Shorten long URLs into short, easy-to-share links
* Redirect from short link to original URL
* Optional support for:

    * Custom aliases
    * URL expiration
    * Analytics

---

## Tech Stack

* Java 21
* Spring Boot 3.5
* Spring Data JPA + MySQL
* Thymeleaf (HTML templating)
* JUnit 5 + Mockito (Testing)
* Maven (Build & dependency management)

## Architecture

```
[User]
   ‚Üì
[Controller] ‚Üí [Service Layer] ‚Üí [Repository] ‚Üí [MySQL Database]
```

* **Controller**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
* **Service**: Contains business logic (e.g., generate short codes)
* **Repository**: Interfaces with MySQL using JPA

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anishvennala/shortlinker.git
   cd shortlinker
   ```

2. **Configure MySQL Database** Edit `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/shortlinker
   spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
   spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

3. **Build and run the project**

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

4. **Open in your browser**

   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

---

## Usage

* Enter a long URL in the form on the homepage
* Click the "Shorten" button
* Receive a shortened URL like `http://localhost:8080/abc123`
* Accessing the short link redirects you to the original long URL

---

## API Endpoints

* **Description**: Shortens a long URL
* **Request Body**:

  ```json
  {
    "originalUrl": "https://example.com/some/long/path"
  }
  ```
* **Response**:

  ```json
  {
    "shortUrl": "http://localhost:8080/abc123"
